# 04 - Value intentionally used in example
The code '103693007' is valid but is not active

# 05 - This is due to the anonymization masking and has been checked
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# 06 - Aware of the deprecation and will update in future release
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/composition-clinicaldocument-versionNumber|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# 08 - For future FHIR R5 consideration
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# 12 - Will consider hard coding the versions at a later date
There are multiple different potential matches for%

# 13 - The next version of eCR will be based on a more recent versions of the IGs
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#4.0.0 released on 2021-06-28, but the most recent appropriate version is 7.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.odh#1.1.0 released on 2021-07-12, but the most recent appropriate version is 1.3.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
