# 04 - Value intentionally used in example
The code '103693007' is valid but is not active

# 05 - This is due to the anonymization masking and has been checked
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'Th'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour

# 06 - Aware of the deprecation and will update in future release (later version of R5)
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/composition-clinicaldocument-versionNumber|5.1.0 is deprecated

# 07 - These value sets are not retired, they have been updated but are not in the VSAC package release version that the eCR IG depends on

# 08 - For future FHIR R5 consideration
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
